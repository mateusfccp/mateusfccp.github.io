Yes, it's been an entire year since the last post. I don't think anyone reads
this anyway.

A lot of things happened since last year, and a lot of changed. First of all,
I've been fired from my last job and I was four months unemployed. Fortunately,
and thanks to God, I'm now employed again. I started working for
[CarOnSale](http://caronsale.de/), and it's been great. The second point,
though, is what prevented me from progressing further with pint°. I started to
study Systems Engineering in the local university. I have already a degree in
Theology, but I never formally studied anything in the IT area, so I decided to
do it.

As you can guess, working a full-time job and studying at the university doesn't
leave me a lot of time to work on side-projects, so this is why I didn't
progress much. I have a work-in-progress branch with some updates, but I don't
remember the last time I worked on it neither have any ETA for it to land.

This is not a farewell, but an uncertainty.
