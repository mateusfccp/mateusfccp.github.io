Welcome to pint째's language overview! Here we are going to tell you what pint째
is, how to use it and its main features.

The pint째 programming language is a language that compiles to Dart.

It has the following objectives:

- Have seamless interoperability with Dart;
- Consider Flutter as first-class;
- Generate reasonably readable and efficient Dart code;
- Be terser and more expressive than Dart;
- Provide a powerful macro system with great ergonomy.

Currently, the language is in a very early state, so all of the objectives are
still to be achieved, in the long term.
