Mateus Felipe Cordeiro Caetano Pinto was born in Campo Mour√£o, PR in Brazil. He was introduced to the world of programming in 2006 through RGSS (Ruby Game Scripting System). Since then, he used a lot of languages, like C, C#, PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Elm, Haskell, ReasonML (now known as ReScript), Dart, HTML, CSS, Common Lisp, Ruby, Python, Lua, Elixir, Visual Basic, SQL, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Swift etc, as he likes to study a little of everything, being a generalist.

He likes to study category theory, type theory, functional programming, and related areas, as well as theology (in which he has a bachelorship).

Currently, he is specializing himself in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), as it is what he works with daily, and is a co-organizer of [Flutterando](https://flutterando.com.br), the biggest Flutter community in Brazil. He works currently in [IATec](https://iatec.com) (Instituto Adventista de Tecnologia) as a Mobile Software Architect.
